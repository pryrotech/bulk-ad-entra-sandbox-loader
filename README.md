# Bulk AD and Entra Sandbox Loader (BAESL)

**BAESL** is a PowerShell-based utility designed for developers and administrators to rapidly populate test environments with realistic identity data. Whether you're working with on-prem Active Directory or Microsoft Entra, BAESL helps simulate real-world usage by:

- Creating bulk user accounts with customizable attributes  
- Automating user actions to mimic authentic behavior  
- Supporting sandboxed environments for safe, repeatable testing  

Ideal for development, demos, and compliance testing, BAESL streamlines identity provisioning so you can focus on what matters: building and validating secure systems.
